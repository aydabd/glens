# GitHub Copilot Instructions

<!-- Single source of truth is .github/instructions/project.instructions.md -->
<!--
  GitHub Copilot (VS Code ≥ 1.99 / Copilot Chat) automatically loads every
  .github/instructions/*.instructions.md file whose `applyTo` glob matches the
  current file.  The canonical project instructions live in:

      .github/instructions/project.instructions.md

  This file is kept for backwards-compatibility with older Copilot versions and
  other tools that look specifically for .github/copilot-instructions.md.
  Do NOT duplicate content here – edit the canonical file instead.
