# Glens Project Instructions

The project coding standards and AI agent instructions are maintained in a single
canonical file to avoid duplication:

**`.github/instructions/project.instructions.md`**

Always read and follow the instructions in that file when working in this repository.
It covers: code style, architecture patterns, testing standards, documentation rules,
critical logic (GitHub issue creation), file structure, and common tasks.
